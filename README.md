# Airport Simulation - Submission A

## Project Setup
- Created a private GitHub repository
- Added "ser316asu" as a collaborator
- Implemented a `Main` class with a basic message
- Configured Gradle with Checkstyle and SpotBugs
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and quality checks

## Chosen Design Patterns
1. **Factory Pattern** - To create different airplane types.
2. **Observer Pattern** - To notify passengers and staff about flight changes.
3. **State Pattern** - To manage airplane states (e.g., landing, taxiing, departure).

## Testing
- Included a basic JUnit test in `src/test/java/MainTest.java`
